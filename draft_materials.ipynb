        "Sparse autoencoders have become a cornerstone of mechanistic interpretability, achieving 70-90% sparsity with minimal dead neurons on low-variance data. However, their behavior on high-variance, chaotic inputs remains unexplored.\n",
        "\n",
        "We discovered this gap while investigating neural networks for entropy generation[My Own Research Placeholder]: despite achieving functional encryption, our dense autoencoder exhibited unexpected variance collapse (10⁻¹²) in the latent space, raising questions about the suitability of neural representations for entropy-sensitive applications. This motivated a systematic empirical study of the sparsity-chaos trade-off through four architectural iterations (V1–V4), revealing that conventional approaches—including L1 regularization (V1: 100% dead neurons) and ReLU-based Top-K selection (V3: variance 0.000036)—systematically fail on chaotic data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our solution, K-Sparse Chaotic Autoencoder (V4), combines learned Top-K selection with a chaos-preserving activation function (sin(8x)+0.5·tanh(4x)) and target-variance regularization. This achieves 75% sparsity with 0% dead neurons and variance of 0.418 (vs 0.000036 in ReLU Top-K), while maintaining reconstruction quality (val loss 0.126). On logistic map 28×28 data, V4 simultaneously preserves chaotic divergence and matches sparsity levels of state-of-the-art sparse autoencoders for large language models.\n",

        "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a fundamental tool in mechanistic interpretability of large language models [Bricken et al. 2023, Templeton et al. 2024]. The core idea is to learn overcomplete dictionaries of interpretable features by enforcing sparsity in the latent space—typically achieving 70-90% sparsity while maintaining reconstruction fidelity. Recent work by Anthropic [Templeton et al. 2024] has scaled SAEs to 34B+ parameter models, demonstrating that sparse representations enable fine-grained understanding of neural network behavior.\n",
